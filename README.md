# Cyber Scheduling Simulator (Python)

This project simulates task scheduling in a cyber-physical system using various Python modules. It was developed as part of a university group assignment and aims to replicate real-time scheduling with constraints, priorities, and modular file handling.

## 📌 Project Objective

- Simulate task scheduling with temporal constraints
- Manage file reading and writing for configuration and output
- Apply date/time logic for simulation control
- Practice modular programming in Python

```

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries: `datetime`, `os`, `csv`, etc.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the main simulation:
```bash
python3 cyberConc/cyberConc.py
```
3. Check the generated outputs or logs as configured.
